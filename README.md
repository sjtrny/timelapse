# timelapse

Container that captures images hourly from my Greenhouse camera's RTSP stream.

Supporting scripts are included to generate videos using ffmpeg from
the captured images.

### Releases

Merging changes into the release branch will trigger a new container build
as defined by the publish workflow.
